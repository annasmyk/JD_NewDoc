Estimation of the exact likelihood of an ARMA model

We suppose that 
$$ y_t, \quad 1 \le t \le n $$
follows an ARMA model.

The X12 implementation computes the exact likelihood in two main steps

#### Overview

We consider the transformation

$$ z_t = \begin{pmatrix} z_{1t} \\ z_{2t} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{cases} y_t, & 1 \le t \le p \\ \Phi\left(B\right) y_t, & p \lt t \le n\end{cases}$$

It is obvious that 
$$ p\left(y_t\right) = p\left(z_t\right) $$

We will estimate
$$ p\left(z_t\right) = p\left(z_{2t}\right)  p\left(z_{1t}\right | z_{2t} )$$

#### Step 1: likelihood of a pure moving average process

$$z_{2t}$$
is a pure moving average process. Its exact likelihood is estimated as follows (see [1] for details).
We list below the different steps of the algorithm.

* Compute the conditional least squares residuals by the recursion:
$$ a_{0t} = \begin{cases} 0,& -q \lt t \leq 0 \\ z_t-\theta_1 a_{0t-1}- \cdots --\theta_q a_{0t-q},&  0 \lt t \leq n  \end{cases} $$

* Compute the Pi-Weights of the model. They defines the (n+q x q) matrix

$$ G = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ \pi_1 & 1 & \cdots & 0 \\ \pi_2 & \pi_1 & \cdots & \vdots\\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ \pi_{n+q-1} & \pi_{n+q-2} & \cdots & \pi_{n} \end{pmatrix} $$

* Compute by recursion
$$ G'a \quad and \quad G'G $$ 

* Compute by Cholesky decomposition
$$ G'G \hat z_* = G'a \quad and \quad |G'G| $$ 

* Obtain by recursion the exact likelihood residuals
$$ \Theta\left(B\right)\begin{pmatrix}\hat a_* \\ \hat a_t \end{pmatrix}  = \begin{pmatrix}z_* \\ z_t \end{pmatrix} $$

The processing defines the linear transformation 
$$ T z_t = \begin{pmatrix}\hat a_* \\ \hat a_t \end{pmatrix} $$ and the searched determinant.

#### Step 2: conditional distribution of the initial observations

$$ p\left(z_{1t}\right | z_{2t} ) $$
is easily obtained by considering the join distribution of 
$$ \left( z_{1t}, z_{2t} \right) \sim N \left( 0, \begin{pmatrix} \Sigma_{11} && \Sigma{12} \\ \Sigma_{21} && \Sigma{22} \end{pmatrix}\right) \ $$

It is distributed as 
$$ N\left( \Sigma_{12} \Sigma_{22}^{-1}v, \Sigma_{11}-\Sigma_{12} \Sigma_{22}^{-1} \Sigma_{21} \right)$$

$$= N\left( \Sigma_{12} T'Tv, \Sigma_{11}-\Sigma_{12} T'T\Sigma_{21} \right)$$

$$  = N\left( U'Tv, \Sigma_{11}-U'U \right)$$

where
* v is obtained by applying the auto-regressive polynomial on the observations
* T is the linear transformation defined in step 1
* 
$$ U = T \Sigma_{21} $$

### Tramo-Seats
links : to praadj, decomp, tools, methods

TRAMO-SEATS is a model-based seasonal adjustment method developed by
Victor Gómez (Ministerio de Hacienda), and Agustin Maravall (Banco de
España). It consists of two linked programs: TRAMO and SEATS. TRAMO
(Time Series Regression with ARIMA Noise, Missing Observations, and
Outliers) performs estimation, forecasting, and interpolation of
regression models with missing observations and ARIMA errors, in the
presence of possibly several types of outlier. SEATS (Signal
Extraction in ARIMA Time Series) performs an ARIMA-based decomposition
of an observed time series into unobserved components. Information about
the TRAMO-SEATS method available in this section derives directly from
papers by Victor Gómez and Agustin Maravall; the most important ones
are: GÓMEZ, V., and MARAVALL, A. (1996), GÓMEZ, V., and MARAVALL, A.
(2001a, b) and MARAVALL, A. (2009). More information about the
TRAMO-SEATS method, TRAMO-SEATS software (DOS version and TSW+ -- Tramo
Seats Windows software and several interfaces) and its documentation as
well as papers on methodology and application of the programs, can be
