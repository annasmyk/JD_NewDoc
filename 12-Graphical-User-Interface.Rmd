The *Model* node includes basic information about the outcome of the
model identification procedure and checking the goodness of fit. The
summary information about the final model is available directly from the
main *Model* node. The content of this panel depends on the [settings](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html) applied to the modelling procedure.



![Text](All_images/image22_RMSB.jpg)

**The *Model* node in the navigation tree**

The first part contains fundamental information about the model.



![Text](All_images/image23_RMSB.jpg)

**The *Summary* section of the *Model* node**

*Estimation span* informs about the first and the last observation used
for modelling. The notation of the estimation span varies according to
the frequencies (for example, the span \[2-1993 : 10-2006\] represents a
monthly time series and the span \[II-1994 : I-2011\] represents a
quarterly time series). The message *Series has been log-transformed* is
only displayed if a logarithmic transformation has been applied.

In the case of [the pre-defined specifications](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html): TR0, TR1, TR3, RG0, RG1
and RG3 no trading day effect is estimated. For TR2, RG2c, TR4 and RG4c
pre-defined specifications, working day effects and the leap year effect
are pre-tested and estimated if present. If the working day effect is
significant, the pre-processing part includes the message *Working days
effect (1 regressor)*. The message *Working days effect (2 regressors)*
means that the leap year effect has also been estimated. For TR5 and
RG5c the trading day effect and the leap year effect are pre-tested. If
the trading day effect has been detected, either of the messages
*Trading days effect (6 regressors)* or *Trading days effect (7
regressors)* are displayed, depending whether the leap year effect has
been detected or not. If the Easter effect is statistically significant,
*Easter effect detected* is displayed.

In this section the total number of detected outliers is displayed. The
additional information on detected outliers, i.e. type, location and
coefficients' values, can be found in the *Arima model* subsection of
the *Model* node.

The *Final model* section informs about the outcome of the estimation
process. *Number of effective observations* is the number of
observations used to estimate the model, i.e. the number of observations
of the transformed series (regularly and/or seasonally differenced)
reduced by the *Number of estimated parameters*, which is the sum of
regular and seasonal parameters for both autoregressive and moving
average processes, mean effect, trading/working day effect, outliers,
regressors and one.

*Likelihood* is a maximized value of a Likelihood[^64] function after
the iterations processed in Exact Maximum Likelihood Estimation, which
is a method used to estimate the model. This value is used by the model
selection criteria: *AIC*, *AICC*, *BIC (corrected by length)* and
*Hannan-Quinn*[^65]. *Standard error of the regression (ML estimate)* is
the standard error of the regression from Maximum Likelihood
Estimation[^66].

The *scores at the solution* section presents the gradient of the
loglikelihood. The different items of the scores are related to the
different parameters of the ARIMA model. The output indicates to which
extent the optimization procedure reached the maximum. At the maximum of
the likelihood, it should be 0. However, it is never exactly the case,
due to numerical approximations. Usually, the scores can be improved by
using a higher precision (smaller tolerance). This precision is
controlled by the **Tolerance** parameter in the **Estimate** section of
the *Specifications* window (see how to use this parameter [for Tramo](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#estimate) and [for
Arima](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-arima.html#estimate)).

An example of the output is presented in the chart below.



![Text](All_images/image24_RMSB.jpg)

**The content of the *Final model* section**

Next, the estimated values of model parameters (*Coefficients*),
t-statistics (*T-Stat*) and corresponding p-values (*P\[\|T\|\>t\]*) are
displayed. JDemetra+ uses the following notation:

-   *Phi(p)* -- the \\(p^{\text{th}}\\) term in the non-seasonal
    autoregressive polynomial;

-   *Theta(q)* -- the $q^{\text{th}}$ term in the non-seasonal moving
    average polynomial;

-   *BPhi(P)* -- the $P^{\text{th}}$ term in the seasonal
    autoregressive polynomial;

-   *BTheta(Q)* -- the $Q^{\text{th}}$ term in the seasonal moving
    average polynomial.

In the example below, the ARIMA model (0,1,1)(0,1,1) was chosen, which
means that one regular and one seasonal moving average parameter were
identified and estimated. The p-values indicate that *BTheta(1)*
parameter is significant in contrast to the *Theta(1)*, which is not
significant [^67].



![Text](All_images/image25_RMSB.jpg)

**The estimation's results of the ARIMA model**

For the [fixed ARIMA parameters](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#tramo-specification--options-for-manual-identification-of-the-arima-model), JDemetra+ shows
only the values of the parameters. Figure below presents the output from
the manually chosen ARIMA model (2,0,0)(0,1,1) with a fixed parameter
*BTheta(1).* For the fixed parameter the *T-Stat* and *(P\|T\|\>t)* are
not displayed as no estimation is done for this parameter.



![Text](All_images/image26_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of the ARIMA model with a fixed coefficient**

If the ARIMA model contains a constant term (detected automatically or
introduced by the user), the estimated value and related statistics are
reported.



![Text](All_images/image27_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of a mean effect**

JDemetra+ presents estimated values of the coefficients of one or six
regressors depending on the type of a calendar effect specification. For
a working days effect one regressor is estimated.



![Text](All_images/image28_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of a working day effect**

When a trading days effect is estimated the *Joint F-test* value is
reported under the table that presents estimated values. When the result
of *Joint F-test* indicates that the trading day variables are jointly
not significant the test result is displayed in red.



![Text](All_images/image29_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of a trading day effect: the case of jointly not significant variables**

In the example below the RSA5c specification has been used and a trading
day effect has been detected. In spite of the fact that some trading day
regressors are not significant at the 5% significance level, the outcome
of the joint F-test indicates that the trading day regressors are
jointly significant (the F-test statistic is lower than 5%).



![Text](All_images/image30_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of a trading day effect: the case of jointly significant variables**

If a leap year regressor has been used in the model specification, the
value of the estimated leap year coefficient is also reported with the
corresponding t-statistics and p-value. As the p-value presented on the
picture below is greater than 0.05, it indicates that the leap year
effect is not significant.



![Text](All_images/image31_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of a leap year effect**

When the option [*UserDefined*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#regression) is used,
JDemetra+ displays the *User-defined calendar variables* section with
variables and corresponding estimation results (the values of the
parameters, corresponding t-statistics and p-values). The outcome of the
joint F-test is displayed when more than one user-defined calendar
variable is used.



![Text](All_images/image32_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of user-defined calendar variables**

When the Easter effect is estimated, the following table is displayed in
the output. In the case presented below Easter has a negative,
significant effect on the time series.



![Text](All_images/image33_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of the Easter effect**

JDemetra+ also presents the results of an outlier detection procedure.
The table includes the type of outlier, its date, the value of the
coefficient and corresponding t-statistics and p-values.



![Text](All_images/image34_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the outlier identification procedure**

In all pre-defined specifications, except for TR0 and RG0, only additive
outliers, temporary changes and level shifts are considered in the
automatic outlier identification procedure. When seasonal outliers are
also enabled, they appear in the same table as other outliers.



![Text](All_images/image35_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the outlier identification procedure that enables seasonal outliers**

Results for [pre-specified outliers](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#regression) are
displayed in a separate table.



![Text](All_images/image36_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of the pre-specified outliers**

Regression variables, like ramps and intervention variables, are not
identified automatically. They need to be defined by the user. The
results of an estimation of ramps that are pre-defined types of
regression variables are displayed in a separate table. All information
concerning ramps, including spans, estimated coefficients and related
statistics, is shown in a separate table.



![Text](All_images/image37_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of the ramp effect**

All other intervention variables with corresponding statistics are shown
under the *Intervention variable(s)* table.



![Text](All_images/image38_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of the intervention variable**

User-defined variables are marked as *Vars-1.x\_1, Vars-1.x\_2*, ...,
*Vars-1.x\_n* and displayed in the separate tables.



![Text](All_images/image39_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of the user-defined variables**

JDemetra+ also reports a list of missing observations, if any. JDemetra+
applies the AO approach to the estimation of the missing
observations[^68].



![Text](All_images/image40_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of the missing observations**

Detailed results are divided into several sections and are investigated
in the following sections:
- [Forecasts](../reference-manual/forecasts.html)
- [Regressors](../reference-manual/regressors.html)
- [ARIMA](../reference-manual/arima.html)
- [Pre-adjustment series](../reference-manual/pre-adjustment-series.html)
- [Residuals](../reference-manual/residuals.html)
- [Likelihood](../reference-manual/likelihood.html)




[^64]: The likelihood function is the joint probability (density)
    function of observable random variables. It is viewed as the
    function of the parameters given the realized random variables.
    Therefore, this function measures the probability of observing the
    particular set of dependent variable values that occur in the
    sample.

[^65]: [AIC, AICC, BIC and Hannan-Quinn criteria are used by
    X-13ARIMA-SEATS while BIC (TRAMO definition)](../theory/SA_lin.html#model-selection-criteria) by TRAMO/SEATS. These criteria
    are used in seasonal adjustment procedures for the selection of the
    optimum ARIMA model. The model with the smaller value of the model
    selection criteria is preferred.

[^66]: Maximum Likelihood Estimation is a statistical method for
    estimating the coefficients of a model. This method determines the
    parameters that maximize the probability (likelihood) of the sample
    data.

[^67]: The variable is called statistically significant if it is so
    extreme that such a result would be expected to arise simply by
    chance only in rare circumstances (with the probability equal to
    p-value). Generally, the regressor is thought to be significant if
    p-value is lower than 5%.

[^68]: Missing observations are treated as additive outliers and
    interpolated accordingly.

### Theoretical spectrum of the Arima model

The *Arima* section demonstrates [a theoretical spectrum](../theory/spectral.html) of the
stationary and non-stationary models. The local menu, which is available
for the graph, offers the copy and export options, including sending the
graph to the printer and saving the graph as clipboard or as a file in
the PNG format. The *Copy all visible* option enables the user to export
time series data to the another application.
