# Graphical User Interface

## Overview

why use the graphical user interface ? what is not directly available in
R yet?

obj here: make parts shorter and steps more obvious SA will be detailed
as the most used (the common pars just linked )

### Chapter oragnisation remarks

#### Modelling vs Pre-adjustment

for linearization via Reg-Arima (or tramo) 2 functions : modelling and
SA, where it is the pre-adjustment part : we'll describe everything in
sa and just ref modelleing (indem rjd) \#### Single series vs multiple
series

## List of Available Algorithms and features

solve the double "documents" in SA and in modelling describe difference
doc vs ws (non output in doc ?) see if the same in version 3

in fine Table (same in R packages and in 03 Main-features ?)

## Installation Procedure

JDemetra+ is a stand-alone application packed in a zip package. To run
JDemetra+ the Java RE 8 or higher is needed. Java RE can be downloaded
from [Oracle
website](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

The official release of JDemetra+ is accessible at [a dedicated Github
page](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdemetra-app/releases). The site
presents all available releases - both official releases (labelled in
green as latest releases) and pre-releases (labelled in red) - packed in
zip packages. From the *Latest release* section either choose the
installer appropriate for your operating system (Windows, Linux, Mac OS,
Solaris) or take the portable zip-file. The installation process is
straightforward and intuitive. For example, when the zip-file is chosen
and downloaded, then under Windows OS the application can be found in
the "bin"-folder of the installation/unpacked zip. To open an
application, double click on nbdemetra.exe or nbdemetra64.exe depending
on the system version (nbdemetra.exe for the 32-bit system version and
nbdemetra64.exe for the 64-bit system version).

![Text](All_images/RunningJDemetra.jpg)

**Launching JDemetra+**

If the launching of JDemetra+ fails, you can try the following
operations:

-   Check if Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE) is properly installed by
    typing in the following command in a terminal: *java --version*

-   Check the logs in your home directory:

    -   %appdata%/.nbdemetra/dev/var/log/ for Windows;

    -   \~/.nbdemetra/dev/var/log/ for Linux and Solaris;

    -   \~/Library/Application Support/.nbdemetra/dev/var/log/ for Mac
        OS X.

In order to remove a previously installed JDemetra+ version, the user
should delete an appropriate JDemetra+ folder.

### Running JDemetra+ {#running-jdemetra}

To open an application, navigate to the destination folder and double
click on *nbdemetra.exe* or *nbdemetra64.exe* depending on the system
version (*nbdemetra.exe* for the 32-bit system version and
*nbdemetra64.exe* for the 64-bit system version).

![Text](All_images/A_Ref1.jpg)

**Running JDemetra+**

### Closing JDemetra+ {#closing-jdemetra}

To close the application, select *File → Exit* from the [File
menu](http://localhost:4000/pages/reference-manual/file.html).

![Text](All_images/A_Ref2.jpg)

**Closing JDemetra+**

The other way is to click on the close box in the upper right-hand
corner of the JDemetra+ window. If there is any unsaved work, JDemetra+
will display a warning and provide the user with the opportunity to save
it. The message box is shown below.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref3.jpg)

## Global structure

here menus and functions common to all the algos

### Interface Starting Winwow

The default view of the JDemetra+ window, which is displayed after
launching the program, is shown below.

![Text](All_images/Jd+mainwindow.jpg)

**JDemetra+ default window**

By default, on the left hand side of the window two panels are visible:
the [*Workspace* panel](../reference-manual/workspace.html) and the
[*Providers* panel](../reference-manual/data-providers.html). The
*Workspace* panel stores the work performed by the user in a coherent
and structured way. The *Providers* panel presents the list of the [data
sources](../quick-start/datasources.html) and organizes the imported
series within each data provider. By default, JDemetra+ supports the
following data sources: \* JDBC; \* ODBC; \* SDMX; \* Excel
spreadsheets; \* TSW (input files for the [Tramo-Seats-Windows
application](https://www.bde.es/bde/en/secciones/servicios/Profesionales/Programas_estadi/Programas.html)
by the Bank of Spain); \* TXT; \* USCB (input files for the
[X-13-ARIMA-SEATS application](https://www.census.gov/srd/www/winx13/)
by the U.S. Census Bureau); \* XML.

All standard databases (Oracle, SQLServer, DB2, MySQL) are supported by
JDemetra+ via JDBC, which is a generic interface to many relational
databases. Other providers can be added by users by creating plugins. We
will now focus on the Spreadsheets data source, which corresponds to the
series prepared in an Excel file. The file should have dates in Excel
date format. Dates should be placed in the first column (or in the first
row) and titles of the series in the corresponding cell of the first row
(or in the first column). The top-left cell [A1] can include text or it
can be left empty. The empty cells are interpreted by JDemetra+ as
missing values and they can appear at the beginning, in the middle and
at the end of the time series. The example is shown below.

![Text](All_images/Spreadsheet.jpg)

**Example of an Excel spreadsheet that can be imported to JDemetra+**

Once the spreadsheet is prepared and saved, it can be imported to
JDemetra+ as it is shown by the tutorial below.

![Alt](All_images/Import_spreadsheet.gif)

**An example of importing process for the Excel file**

The default JDemetra+ window, which is displayed after launching the
program, is clearly divided into several panels.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref_d28.jpg)

**JDemetra+ default view**

The key parts of the user interface are: \* The [application
menu](#application-menu). \* The [Providers](data-providers.html)
window, which organises time series; \* The [Workspace](workspace.html)
window, which stores results generated by the software as well as
settings used to create them; \* A central empty zone for presenting the
actual analyses further called the [Results](#results-panel) panel.

### Application menu {#application-menu}

The majority of functionalities are available from the main application
menu, which is situated at the very top of the main window. If the user
moves the cursor to an entry in the main menu and clicks on the left
mouse button, a drop-down menu will appear. Clicking on an entry in the
drop-down menu selects the highlighted item.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref10.jpg)

**The main menu with selected drop-down menu**

The functions available in the main application menu are: \*
[File](file.html) \* [Statistical methods](Statistical-methods.html) \*
[X-13Doc](x-13doc.html) \* [RegArimaDoc](regarimadoc.html) \*
[TramoDoc](tramodoc.html) \* [TramoSeatsDoc](tramoseatsdoc.html) \*
[View](view.html) \* [Tools](tools.html) \* [Window](window.html) \*
[Help](help.html)

### Results panel {#results-panel}

The blank zone in the figure above (on the right of the view) is the
location where JDemetra+ displays various windows. More than one window
can be displayed at the same time. Windows can overlap with each other
with the foremost window being the one in focus or active. The active
window has a darkened title bar. [The windows in the results panel can
be arranged in many different ways](../reference-manual/window.html),
depending on the user's needs. The example below shows one of the
possible views of this panel. The results of the user's analysis are
displayed in an accompanying window. The picture below shows two panels
-- a window containing seasonal adjustment results (upper panel) and
another one containing an autoregressive spectrum (lower panel).

![Text](All_images/A_Ref9.jpg)

**The *Results* panel filled with two windows**

### Menus

#### File Menu

The *File* menu is intended for working with
[workspaces](workspace.html) and [data
sources](../reference-manual/data-providers.html). It offers the
following functions:\
\* **New Workspace** -- creates a new workspace and displays it in the
*Workspace* window with a default name (*Workspace\_#number*); \* **Open
Workspace** -- opens a dialog window, which enables the user to select
and open an existing workspace; \* **Open Recent Workspace** -- presents
a list of workspaces recently created by the user and enables the user
to open one of them; \* **Save Workspace** -- saves the project file
named by the system under the default name (*Workspace\_#number*) and in
a default location. The workspace can be re-opened at a later time; \*
**Save Workspace As...** -- saves the current workspace under the name
chosen by the user in the chosen location. The workspace can be
re-opened at a later time; \* **Open Recent** -- presents a list of
datasets recently used and enables the user to open one of them; \*
**Exit** -- closes an application.

![Text](All_images/File%20menu.jpg)

**The content of the *File* menu**

#### View Menu

The View menu contains functionalities that enable the user to modify
how JDemetra+ is viewed. It offers the following items: \* **Split** --
the function is not operational in the current version of the software.
\* **Toolbars** -- displays selected toolbars under the main menu. The
*File* toolbar contains the *Save all* icon. The *Performance* toolbar
includes two icons: one to show the performance of the application, the
other to stop the application profiling and taking a snapshot. The
*Other* toolbar determines the default behaviour of the program when the
user double clicks on the data. It may be useful to plot the data,
visualise it on a grid, or to perform any pre-specified action, e.g.
execute a seasonal adjustment procedure. \* **Show Only Editor** --
displays only the *Results* panel and hides other windows (e.g.
*Workspace* and *Providers*). \* **Full Screen** -- displays the current
JDemetra+ view in full screen.

![Text](All_images/View%20menu.jpg)

**The *View* menu**

#### Window menu

The *Window* menu offers several functions that facilitate the analysis
of data and enables the user to adjust the interface view to the user's
needs.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref51.jpg)

**The *Window* menu**

-   **Preview Time Series** -- opens a window that plots any of the
    series the user selects from *Providers*.

-   **Debug** -- opens a *Preview Time Series* window that enables a
    fast display of the graphs for time series from a large dataset. To
    display the graph click on the series in the *Providers* window.

-   [**Providers**](../reference-manual/data-providers.html) -- opens
    (if closed) and activates the *Providers* window.

-   [**Variables**](../reference-manual/user-defined-variables.html) --
    opens (if closed) and activates the *Variable* window.

-   [**Workspace**](../reference-manual/workspace.html) -- opens (if
    closed) and activates the *Workspace* window.

-   **Output** -- a generic window to display outputs in the form of
    text; useful with certain plug-ins (e.g. tutorial descriptive
    statistics).

-   **Editor** -- activates the editor panel (and update the main menu
    consequently).

-   **Configure Window** -- enables the user to change the way that the
    window is displayed (maximise, float, float group, minimise,
    minimise group). This option is active when some window is displayed
    in the JD+ interface.

-   **Properties** -- opens the *Properties* window and displays the
    properties of the marked item (e.g. time series, data source).

-   **Reset Windows** -- restores the default JDemetra+ view.

-   **Close Window** -- closes all windows that are open.

-   **Close All Documents** -- closes all documents that are open.

-   **Close Other Documents** -- closes all documents that are open
    except for the one that is active (which is the last activated one).

-   **Document Groups** -- enables the user to create and manage the
    document groups.

-   **Documents** -- lists all documents that are active.

#### Workspace Menu

Workspace is a JDemetra+ functionality that stores the work performed by
the user in a coherent and structured way. By default, each workspace
contains the pre-defined modelling and seasonal adjustment
specifications and a basic calendar. A specification is a set of
modelling and/or seasonal adjustment parameters. Within the workspace
the following items can be saved: \* [User-defined modelling
specifications](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html#user-definedSpec)
and [seasonal adjustment
specifications](../reference-manual/sa-specifications.html); \*
Documents that contain [results from time series
modelling](../reference-manual/output-modelling.html) and [output from
the seasonal adjustment process](../reference-manual/output.html); \*
[User-defined calendars](../reference-manual/calendars.html); \*
[User-defined regression
variables](../reference-manual/user-defined-variables.html).

Together with the results from modelling and seasonal adjustment, the
original data, paths to the input files and parameters of processes are
all saved. These results can then be re-opened, updated, investigated
and modified in further JDemetra+ sessions.

The workspace saved by JDemetra+ includes: \* Main folder containing
several folders that correspond to the different types of items created
by the user and; \* The xml file that enables the user to import the
workspace to the application and to display its content.

An example of the workspace is shown in the figure below.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref7.jpg)

**A workspace saved on PC**

The workspace can be shared with other users, which eases the burden of
work with defining specifications, modelling and seasonal adjustment
processes.

The content of the workspace is presented in the *Workspace* window. It
is divided into three sections: \*
[Modelling](../reference-manual/modelling.html) (contains the default
and user-defined specifications for modelling; and the output from the
modelling process) \* [Seasonal adjustment](../reference-manual/sa.html)
(contains the default and user-defined specifications for seasonal
adjustment and the output from the seasonal adjustment process), \*
Utilities ([calendars](calendars.html) and [user defined
variables](user-defined-variables.html)).

![Text](All_images/A_Ref8.jpg)

**The *Workspace* window**

#### Statistical Methods Menu

The Statistical methods menu includes functionalities for modelling,
analysis and the seasonal adjustment of a time series. They are divided
into three groups: \* [Anomaly Detection](#anomaly-detection) -- allows
for a purely automatic identification of regression effects; \*
[Modelling](#modelling) -- enables time series modelling using the TRAMO
and RegARIMA models; \* [Seasonal adjustment](#seasonal-adjustment) --
intended for the seasonal adjustment of a time series with the
TRAMO-SEATS and X-13ARIMA-SEATS methods.

![Text](All_images/Statistical%20methods%20menu.jpg)

**The *Statistical methods* menu.**

### Anomaly Detection {#anomaly-detection}

The primary goal of the functionalities that are available in the
*Anomaly Detection* section is the identification of atypical values
called outliers. According to the ['*ESS Guidelines on Seasonal
Adjustment*'](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/6830795/KS-GQ-15-001-EN-N.pdf/d8f1e5f5-251b-4a69-93e3-079031b74bd3)
(2015), seasonal adjustment methods are likely to be severely affected
by the presence of such values; therefore they should be detected and
replaced simultaneously or before estimating the seasonal and calendar
components in order to avoid a distorted or biased estimation.

The use of the RegARIMA models is recommended by the '*ESS Guidelines on
Seasonal Adjustment*' (2015) to estimate and remove outliers before
estimating the seasonal effect. As the presence of outliers could
greatly affect the quality of the decomposition, the various types of
outlier (i.e. additive outliers, transitory changes, level shifts, etc.)
should be detected and corrected for.

This element of quality control should be performed each time new or
revised data become available. Manual inspection of the data is
problematic, especially in the case of large datasets. Also, it usually
relies on some simple measures, which do not consider the full
information contained in the series, but just a few values. Therefore
the results of the manual inspection can be severaly affected by
seasonality, noise, or special events.

JDemetra+ includes two tools dedicated to the automatic identification
of outliers: *Check Last* and *Outliers Detection*. Both are based on
the TERROR program, which is an application from TRAMO. TERROR is
executed by both tools to automatically (with several available options)
detect outliers.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref13.jpg)

**The *Anomaly detection* menu.**

#### Check Last {#check-last}

The *Check Last* tool automatically detects using the TRAMO model
forecasts up to three last observations and marks the observations that
are too different from their forecasted values. The *Check Last* *Batch*
window is divided into three panels. The panel on the left presents the
list of the analysed series. The results are dispalyed in the panels on
the right.

To launch the analysis, drag and drop a series from the *Providers*
window into the left hand side panel of the *Check Last Batch* window
and click the *Start* button (denoted with the green arrow) from the
menu in the top part of the window. The analysis will be performed using
the TRAMO specification selected from the list. By default, TR4 is used.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref14.jpg)

**The *Check Last* initial window with series to be processed and the
list of available specifications expanded.**

JDemetra+ removes the last observations from the series and calculates a
one-period-ahead out-of-sample forecast of the series. The forercasted
values are then compared with the actual values. The user may decide how
many of the last observations will be considered (one, two, or three) in
this procedure (click on the **123** button and specify the number). The
number of columns visible in the panel on the left will be adjusted
accordingly to the user's choice.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref15.jpg)

**The options for number of observations to be examined.**

The default settings can be changed in the *Properties* dialog box (the
number of last observations that will be compared to the forecasted
values, specification used for modelling and the threshold values used
to decide if observations are abnormal). To open it, click on the button
marked with the working tools.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref16.jpg)

**The properties for the *Check Last* functionality.**

Once the process is executed, click on the series on the list to display
the results. For each series the program automatically identifies an
ARIMA model, detects several types of outliers, interpolates missing
values and estimates the calendar effects, if appropriate. Study the
detailed results section using the vertical scrollbar.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref17.jpg)

**The results of the outlier's detection process.**

The last observations (one, two or three, depending of the user's
choice) are compared with the forecasted values. If, for a given
observation, the forecast error divided by a standard deviation of
residuals is greater than the first threshold value and lower than the
second threshold value, then this observation is classified as
containing a "possible error" and marked in orange. If this value is
greater than the second threshold value, then the new observation is
classified as containing a "likely error" and marked in red. Otherwise,
the observation is accepted as "without an
error"[^graphical-user-interface-1].

[^graphical-user-interface-1]: Description of the idea of benchmarking
    is based on Dagum, B.E., Cholette, P.A. 1994), and Quenneville, B.
    et all (2003). Detailed information can be found in: Dagum, B.E.,
    Cholette, P.A. (2006).

![Text](All_images/A_Ref18.jpg)

**Investigation of the outliers' detection results.**

JDemetra+ enables the user to save the results of this analysis in the
compact form of a report. To generate it, click on the **Generate
Report** button and specify the sorting options.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref19.jpg)

**The *Generate Report* functionality.**

To save the report click **OK** and select a destination folder.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref20.jpg)

**Report from the outliers' detection process.**

#### Outlier detection {#outlier-detection}

The *Outlier Detection* tool allows for the identification of an ARIMA
model, including the detection of outliers, interpolation of missing
values and the estimation of any calendar effects. A step-by-step
demonstration of the *Outlier Detection* tool capabilities and options
can be found [here](../case-studies/modelling-basic.html).

### Modelling {#modelling}

The aim of the *Modelling* section is to provide tools for time series
modelling and forecasting without performing the estimation of its
components and decomposition. The estimated results can be useful for
time series analysis and in the prediction of short-term developments.

The *Modelling* section includes all capabilities from the TRAMO and
RegARIMA models. It is flexible in [specifying model
parameters](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html). The
results can be saved and refreshed with updated series. Instructions on
how to use this functionality is given in [the step-by-step
demonstration on advanced time series
analysis](../case-studies/modelling-advanced.html).

![Text](All_images/A_Ref21.jpg)

**The *Modelling* menu.**

### Seasonal Adjustment {#seasonal-adjustment}

The *Seasonal Adjustment* section provides tools to perform seasonal
adjustment for a single time series as well as for multiple time series
using the TRAMO-SEATS or X-13ARIMA-SEATS methods. It also offers several
seasonality tests that can be used to scrutinize the presence and the
nature of seasonal movements in a time series independently from the
seasonal adjustment. Finally, the *Direct-Indirect Seasonal Adjustment*
tool enables a comparison of the results from direct and indirect
seasonal adjustment performed on the aggregated series.

The guidance for using these functionalities is given in the [Case
studies](../case-studies) section: - [basic scenario detailing the use
of automatic modelling in seasonal
adjustment](../case-studies/simplesa.html); - [different types of user
interventions](../case-studies/detailedsa.html); - [*Seasonality
Tests*](../case-studies/seasonalitytests.html); - [*Direct-Indirect
Seasonal Adjustment*](../case-studies/detailedsa-direct.html).

![Text](All_images/A_Ref22.jpg)

**The *Seasonal Adjustment* menu.**

### Importing data : the *providers* window

The *Providers* window presents the list of the data sources and
organises the imported series within each data provider.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref5.jpg)

**The *Providers* window**

The allowed data sources include: \* JDBC; \* ODBC; \* SDMX; \*
Spreadsheets; \* TSW; \* TXT; \* USCB; \* XML.

All standard databases (Oracle, SQLServer, DB2, MySQL) are supported by
JDemetra+ via JDBC, which is a generic interface to many relational
databases. Other providers can be added by users by creating plugins
(see *Plugins* section in the [Tools](tools.html) menu). To import data,
right-click on the appropriate provider from the *Providers* panel and
specify the required parameters. For all providers the procedure follows
the same logic. An example is provided [here](#import-data).

The *Providers* window organises data in a tree structure reflecting the
manner in which data are presented in the original source. The picture
below presents how JDemetra+ visualises the imported spreadsheet file.
If the user expands all the pluses under the spreadsheet all the series
within each sheet that has been loaded are visible. Here two time series
are visible: *Japan* (under the *Asia* branch) and *United States*
(under the *North America* branch) while the *Europe* branch is still
folded. The names of the time series have been taken from the column
headings of the spreadsheet while the names of the branches come from
sheets' names.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref6.jpg)

**A structure of a dataset**

Series uploaded to the *Providers* window can be
[displayed](../reference-manual/data-visualization.html), modified and
[tested for seasonality](../case-studies/seasonalitytests.html) and used
in estimation routines (see [Modelling](modelling.html) and [Seasonal
adjustment](sa.html)). The data sources can be restored after
re-starting the application so that there is no need to get them again.
This functionality can be set in the *Behaviour* tab available at the
[*Option*](../reference-manual/tools.html#options) item from the
[*Tools*](../reference-manual/tools.html) menu.

#### Spreadsheets {#spreadsheets}

The Spreadsheets data source corresponds to the series prepared in the
Excel file. The file should have true dates in the first column (or in
the first row) and titles of the series in the corresponding cell of the
first row (or in the first column). The top-left cell $$A1$$ can include
a text or it can be left empty. The empty cells are interpreted by
JDemetra+ as missing values and they can appear in the beginning, in the
middle and in the end of time series.

An example is presented below:

![Text](All_images/Aimage5.jpg)

**Example of an Excel spreadsheet that can be imported to JDemetra+**

Time series are identified by their names. JDemetra+ derives some
information (like data periodicity, starting and ending period) directly
from the first column (or from the first row, depending on the chosen
data orientation (vertical or horizontal)).

#### Import data {#import-data}

To import data from a given data source, click on this data source in
the *Providers* window shown below, choose *Open* option and specify the
import details, such as a path to a data file. These details vary
according to data providers. The example below show how to import the
data from an Excel file.

1.  From the *Providers* window right-click on the *Spreadsheets* branch
    and choose *Open* option.

    ![Text](All_images/Aimage6.jpeg)

    **Data provider available by default**

2.  The *Open data source* window contains the following options:

    -   **Spreadsheet file** -- a path to access the Excel file.

    -   **Data format** -- the data format used to read dates and
        values. It includes three fields: *locale* (country), *date
        pattern* (data format, e.g. *yyyy-mm-dd*), *number pattern* (a
        metaformat of numeric value, e.g. 0.## represents two digit
        number).

    -   **Frequency** -- time series frequency. This can be undefined,
        yearly, half-yearly, four-monthly, quarterly, bi-monthly, or
        monthly. When the frequency is set to undefined, JDemetra+
        determines the time series frequency by analysing the sequence
        of dates in the file.

    -   **Aggregation type** -- the type of aggregation (over time for
        each time series in the dataset) for the imported time series.
        This can be *None*, *Sum*, *Average*, *First*, *Last*, *Min* or
        *Max*. The aggregation can be performed only if the *frequency*
        parameter is specified. For example, when frequency is set to
        *Quarterly* and aggregation type is set to *Average*, a monthly
        time series is transformed to quarterly one with values that are
        equal to the one third of the sum of the monthly values that
        belong to the corresponding calendar quarter.

    -   **Clean missing** -- erases the missing values of the series.

    Next, in the *Source* section click the grey "...." button (see
    below) to open the file.

    ![Text](All_images/Aimage7.jpeg)

    **Data source window**

3.  Choose a file and click *OK*.

    ![Text](All_images/Aimage8.jpeg)

    **Choice of an Excel spreadsheet**

4.  The user may specify *Data format*, *Frequency* and *Aggregation
    type*, however this step is not compulsory. When these options are
    specified JDemetra+ is able to convert the time series frequency.
    Otherwise, the functionality that enables the time series frequency
    to be converted will not be available.

    ![Text](All_images/Aimage9.jpeg)

    **Options for importing data**

5.  The data are organized in a tree structure.

    ![Text](All_images/Aimage10.jpeg)

    **Dataset structure**

    Once the data has been successfully imported, it is available to the
    user for various analyses (e.g. visualization, modelling, seasonal
    adjustment, etc.)

### Charts

#### Data visualization

1.  To display a given series, right click on it and choose the *Chart &
    grid* option from the local menu. The graph is displayed in the
    panel on the right.

    ![Text](All_images/Aimage11.jpeg)

    **Time series graph**

2.  Using the local menu that is available for the chart the user may
    adjust the view of the picture, save it and/or save it in a given
    location.

    ![Text](All_images/Aimage12.jpeg)

    **Local menu basic options for the time series graph**

3.  Once the time series is marked by clicking on it with the left mouse
    button, more sophisticated options are available, in addition to the
    standard ones shown above.

    ![Text](All_images/Aimage13.jpeg)

    **Full local menu options**

4.  These additional options include the *Open with* option, which opens
    time series in a separate window according to the user choice (chart
    & grid or only chart). *All ts views* option is not available at the
    moment. The picture below shows the view displayed once *Chart &
    grid* option was chosen. By clicking on the marked buttons the user
    can switch between chart and grid view. For both views (chart and
    grid) the local menu is available.

    ![Text](All_images/Aimage14.jpeg)

    ***Chart & grid*** **view**

5.  *Rename* option (see below) enables the user to change the time
    series name.

    ![Text](All_images/Aimage15.jpeg)

    **Renaming a time series**

6.  The option *Split into the yearly components* opens an additional
    window that presents the analysed series data split by year. This
    chart is useful to investigate the differences in time series values
    caused by the seasonal factors. The graph gives some idea about the
    existence and size of deterministic and stochastic seasonality in
    data.

    ![Text](All_images/Aimage16.jpeg)

    ***Split into the yearly components*** **option's result**

7.  To display more than one series on the graph, select *Tools* →
    *Container* → *Chart* from the main menu. Next, drag a drop series
    to the *Chart* window.

#### Charts for spectral Analysis

![Text](All_images/image3_342.jpeg)

**Auto-regressive spectrum's properties**

1.  The spectral graphs are available from: *Tools* → *Spectral
    analysis.*

    ![Text](All_images/image1_342.jpeg)

    **Tools for spectral analysis**

2.  When the first option is chosen JDemetra+ displays an empty
    *Auto-regressive spectrum* window. To start an analysis drag a
    single time series from the *Providers* window and drop it into the
    *Drop data here* area.

    ![Text](All_images/image2_342.jpeg)

    **Launching an auto-regressive spectrum**

3.  An auto-regressive spectrum graph available in JDemetra+ is based on
    the relevant tool from the X-13ARIMA-SEATS program. It shows the
    spectral density (spectrum) function, which reformulates the content
    of the stationary time series' autocovariances in terms of
    amplitudes at frequencies of half a cycle per month or less. The
    number of observations, data transformations and other options such
    as the specification of the frequency grid and the order of the
    autoregressive polynomial (30 by default) can be specified by
    opening the *Window* → *Properties* from the main menu.

    The *Auto-regressive - Properties* window contains the following
    options:

    -   **Log** - a log transformation of a time series;

    -   **Differencing** - transforms a data by calculating a regular
        (order 1,2..) or seasonal (order 4, 12, depending on the time
        series frequency) differences;

    -   **Differencing lag** - the number of lags that the program will
        use to take differences. For example, if *Differencing lag = 3*
        then the differencing filter does not apply to the first lag
        (default) but to the third lag.

    -   **Last years** - a number of years at the end of the time series
        taken to produce autoregresive spectrum. By default, it is 0,
        which means that the whole time series is considered.

    -   **Auto-regressive polynomial order** - the number of lags in the
        AR model that is used to estimate the spectral density. By
        default, the order of the autoregressive polynomial is set to 30
        lags.

    -   **Resolution** - the value 1 plots the spectral density estimate
        for the frequencies $\omega_{j} = \frac{2\pi j}{n}$, where
        $n \in ( - \pi;\pi)$ is the size of the sample used to estimate
        the AR model. Increasing this value, which is set to 5 by
        default, will increase the precision of this grid.

4.  The seasonality test described above uses an empirical criterion to
    check whether the series has a seasonal component that is
    predictable (stable) enough that it can be estimated with reasonable
    success. The peak in the [auto-regressive
    spectrum](../theory/spectral_AR.html) has to be greater than the
    median of the 61 spectrum ordinates and has to exceed the two
    adjacent spectral values by more than a critical value. When such a
    case is detected, the test results are displayed in green.

    ![Text](All_images/image4_342.jpeg)

    **An example of an-auto-regressive spectrum**

5.  The second spectral graph is a periodogram. To perform the analysis
    of a single time series using this tool, choose *Tools* →*Spectral
    analysis* → *Periodogram* and drag and drop a series from the
    *Providers* window to the empty *Periodogram* window.

    ![Text](All_images/image5_342.jpeg)

    **Launching a periodogram**

6.  The sample size and data transformations can be specified by opening
    the *Window* → *Properties*, in the main menu. The *Periodogram -
    Properties* window contains the following options:

    -   **Log** - a log transformation of a time series;

    -   **Differencing** - transforms the data by calculating regular
        (order 1,2..) or seasonal (order 4, 12, depending on the time
        series frequency) differences;

    -   **Differencing lag** - the number of lags that you will use to
        take differences. For example, if *Differencing lag = 3* then
        the differencing filter does not apply to the first lag
        (default) but to the third lag.

    -   **Last years** - the number of years at the end of the time
        series taken to produce periodogram. By default it is 0, which
        means that the whole time series is considered.

    ![Text](All_images/image6_342.jpeg)

    **Periodogram's properties**

7.  The [periodogram](../theory/spectral_periodogram.html) was one of
    the earliest tools used for the analysis of time series in the
    frequency domain. It enables the user to identify the dominant
    periods (or frequencies) of a time series. In general, the
    periodogram is a wildly fluctuating estimate of the spectrum with a
    high variance and is less stable than an auto-regressive spectrum.

    ![Text](All_images/image7_342.jpeg)

    **An example of a periodogram**

8.  The third spectral graph is the Tukey spectrum. To perform the
    analysis of time series using this tool, choose *Tools* → *Spectral
    analysis* → *Tukey spectrum* and drag and drop a single series from
    the *Providers* window to the empty *Periodogram* window*.*

    ![Text](All_images//image8_342.jpeg)

    **Launching a Tukey spectrum**

9.  The Tukey spectrum estimates the spectral density by smoothing the
    periodogram.

    ![Text](All_images/image9_342.jpeg)

    **An example of a Tukey spectrum**

10. The options for the Tuckey window can be specified by opening the
    *Window* → *Properties* from the main menu. The *Periodogram -
    Properties* window contains the following options:

    -   **Log** - a log transformation of a time series.

    -   **Differencing** - transforms the data by calculating regular
        (order 1, 2..) or seasonal (order 4, 12, depending on the time
        series frequency) differences.

    -   **Differencing lag** - the number of lags that you will use to
        take differences. For example, if *Differencing lag = 3* then
        the differencing filter does not apply to the first lag
        (default) but to the third lag.

    -   **Taper part** -- parameter larger than 0 and smaller or equal
        to one that shapes the curvature of the smoothing function that
        is applied to the auto-covariance function.

    -   **Window length** -- the size of the window that is used to
        smooth the auto-covariance function. A value of zero includes
        the whole series.

    -   **Window type** -- it refers to the weighting scheme that it is
        used to smooth the auto-covariance function. The available
        windows types (*Square*, *Welch*, *Tukey*, *Barlett*, *Hamming*,
        *Parzen*) are suitable to estimate the spectral density.

#### Quick demonstration

For a detailed demonstration of the seasonal adjustment process, please
refer to the [JDemetra+
Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYDyEqMSjZ8&t=) video
developed by Andreea Mirica (Statistics Romania). For a step-by-step
illustration of the key stages for seasonal adjustment, refer to the
guidance below.

The default view of the JDemetra+ window, which is displayed after
launching the program, is shown below.

![Text](All_images/Jd+mainwindow.jpg)

**JDemetra+ default window**

By default, on the left hand side of the window two panels are visible:
the [*Workspace* panel](../reference-manual/workspace.html) and the
[*Providers* panel](../reference-manual/data-providers.html). The
*Workspace* panel stores the work performed by the user in a coherent
and structured way. The *Providers* panel presents the list of the [data
sources](../quick-start/datasources.html) and organizes the imported
series within each data provider.

##### Importing the series

Once the spreadsheet is prepared as it is shown
[here](../quick-start/datasources.html) and saved, it can be imported to
JDemetra+ as it is shown in the video below.

![Text](All_images/Import_spreadsheet.gif)

**Importing the series**

The data are organized in a tree structure. If you expand all the
plus-signs under the spreadsheet you will see all the series within each
sheet that has been loaded. Here all time series are visible under the
*Production in construction* branch. The names of time series have been
taken from the columns' headings of the spreadsheet while the names of
the branches come from sheets' names.

## An automatic seasonal adjustment

To execute a seasonal adjustment process of given time series dataset go
to the main menu and follow the path: **Statistical methods → Seasonal
adjustment → Multi Processing → New**. This command opens an empty
*SAProcessing* window. Next, drag and drop series in the *SAProcessing*
window and launch the seasonal adjustment process. Explore the results
and save them. The gif below shows the details of the actions performed
in an automatic seasonal adjustment process.

![Text](All_images/FirstSAprocess.gif)

**An example of an automatic seasonal adjustment process**

##### Manual interventions

The specifications used for seasonal adjustment of an individual series
can be changed as shown in the presentation below. Be aware that the
changes introduced in a given settings' section may lead to changes in
the output for other parts of the results. The options for the
pre-processing of the series are explained under [modelling
specifications](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html) and
the options for the pure seasonal adjustment process are explained under
[seasonal adjustment
specifications](../reference-manual/sa-specifications.html).

![Text](All_images/First-SA-process-specifcation.gif)

**An example of manual interventions to the seasonal adjustment
process**

##### Output options

To export the results of seasonal adjustment for the whole dataset,
select the *Output* item from the *SAProcessing* menu.

![Text](All_images/output.jpg)

**The *SAProcessing* menu**

The procedure to extract the output is explained
[here](../case-studies/output.html) in detail. The results can be
exported to CSV, CVS matrix, TXT and XLS formats and the list of
available items depends on the format choice. The CVS, TXT and XLS
formats are used to save the results in a form of the time series. The
CVS matrix is a format for saving various diagnostics and statistics.
The list of available items is available [here](../theory/output.html).

### Simple seasonal adjustment of a single time series

This scenario guides the user through all the steps of the process
required to seasonally adjust a single time series. Links to the
appropriate parts of the [*Reference
Manual*](../pages/reference-manual/) for detailed explanations are
provided when necessary.

1.  Go to the main menu and follow the path: *Statistical methods* →
    *Seasonal adjustment* → *Single analysis*. Select a seasonal
    adjustment method (*TramoSeats* (i.e. the TRAMO-SEATS method will be
    used) or *X13* (i.e. the X13ARIMA-SEATS will be used).

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image1.jpg)

    **Launching seasonal adjustment for a single time series**

2.  An empty panel will be opened. The picture below shows the view when
    the X-13ARIMA-SEATS method is chosen.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image2.jpg)

    **Single analysis window**

3.  Select a data provider and unfold an already imported dataset. Drag
    and drop one time series from the *Providers* window to the *Drop
    data here* box as shown below. The window contains two panels. The
    one on the left presents the structure of the output in the form of
    an output tree. The other one is empty. Once the seasonal adjustment
    has been performed, this panel will show detailed results for any
    item chosen by the user from the output tree.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image3.jpg)

    **Starting a seasonal adjustment process**

4.  When the user drops a series into the document window (X13Doc in the
    example presented in this scenario) JDemetra+ starts the seasonal
    adjustment process automatically. By default, a summary of results
    is displayed. It is accompanied by two graphs: an overlay graph on
    the left with the original unadjusted series, the
    seasonally-adjusted series and the trend-cycle and the *SI ratio*
    graph on the right. The diagnostics and graphs for the modelling
    part are discussed
    [here](../reference-manual/output-modelling.html). The user can find
    also find some explanations of the [results of seasonal adjustment
    for X-13ARIMA-SEATS](../reference-manual/sa-output-X13.html) and for
    [TRAMO-SEATS](../reference-manual/sa-output-tramo.html)). The *Main
    results* panel provides a quick summary of the quality of the
    adjustment. Study the diagnostics section using the vertical
    scrollbar.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image4.jpg)

    **Simple seasonal adjustment, single time series: main results
    panel**

5.  The results are highlighted in green, yellow or red, depending on
    the result of the statistical test used. Green indicates that
    problematic characteristics have not been detected (e.g. lack of
    normality of residuals, autocorrelation in residuals). Yellow
    indicates that the test outcome is uncertain. Those in red indicate
    that there are issues that should be addressed. The user is expected
    to investigate the problematic test statistics and try to improve
    the model, so that no uncertain or rejected test results are
    present.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image5.jpg)

    **Diagnostic results - simple seasonal adjustment of single time
    series**

6.  To explore the results, expand the tree in the left panel and click
    on the desired node. Here [*Out-of-sample
    test*](../reference-manual/forecasts.html) was chosen.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image6.jpg)

    **Exploring the results**

7.  The default specification used for a seasonal adjustment can be
    modified by clicking on the *Specifications* button.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image7.jpg)

    **Changing a default specification**

8.  The *Specifications* panel presents settings that have been used to
    generate the current output.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image8.jpg)

    **Specification panel**

9.  To change a given setting, click on it and choose an option from the
    list and/or enter a value. In the picture below the series span was
    shortened by the first 12 observations. Inputs in green indicate
    that the entered values are acceptable (appropriate format, data
    within the allowed range and so on). To apply the changes click on
    the *Apply* button in the bottom part of the window.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image9.jpg)

    **Modifying settings**

10. Be aware that the changes introduced may lead to changes in the
    output for other parts of the results. The example below illustrates
    that omitting the first 12 observations results in automatic
    detection of trading day effects and the Easter effect, which were
    not present in the previous model.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image10.jpg)

    **The effect of applying modified settings**

11. To copy the estimated series (seasonally adjusted, trend, seasonal
    and irregular) to another file go to the *Table* item in the *Main
    results* section of the output tree. Then click on the upper-left
    cell in the table.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image11.jpg)

    **Highlighting the output series**

12. Copy the series by clicking the *Copy* item from the context menu or
    use the standard *Ctrl+C* keys. Other options from this menu are
    explained [here](../reference-manual/input.html).

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image12.jpg)

    **Copying the series**

13. Paste the series to the destination file (e.g. TXT, Excel).

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image13.jpg)

    **Easy exporting data to an Excel file**

14. To save the document created in JDemetra+ (named *X13Doc-1* in our
    example) select *Save Workspace As...* item from the *File* menu.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image14.jpg)

    **Saving a workspace**

15. Enter the location, workspace name and click *Save.*

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image15.jpg)

    **Choosing a destination folder**

16. The document is visible in the *Workspace* window under the
    appropriate section (*x13* in the case presented in the picture).
    The document can be opened, deleted or renamed from the context
    menu.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image16.jpg)

    **The content of the context menu for a single document**

17. The user can also add comments to the document. To display the
    comments and modify them, click on *Edit comments* from the context
    menu.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image17.jpg)

    **An example of an *Edit comments* window**

18. At the end of this process, the user is presented with the results
    already saved in the workspace. The option *Refresh data* becomes
    active when the given workspace is opened again. This option can be
    activated either from a local menu or from the main menu. Once it is
    activated, JDemetra+ refers to the data source defined in the
    workspace and uses this current version of data to perform seasonal
    adjustment with the settings saved in the document.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image18.jpg)

    **Refreshing the data**

### Specifications, documents, multi-documents

![Text](All_images/A_Ref_d2.jpg)

\*\*The *Workspace* window with the nodes for the seasonal adjustment
procedure marked

Seasonal adjustment can be performed with pre-defined or user-defined
specifications. In general, these specifications include also a
modelling part, which is descibed under the [Modelling
section](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html).
Specifications are sets of parameters and values assigned to them that
contain all information necessary for seasonal adjustment. The
specifications for seasonal adjustment can be used for processing of a
single time series as well as a large dataset. The default critical
values used by the tests included in the specifications can be changed
by the user in the [*Tools* \\(\rightarrow\\) *Options*
menu](../reference-manual/tools.html#options).

#### Pre-defined specifications

The *Seasonal adjustment* section of the *Workspace* window contains a
set of pre-defined specifications that enables the user to seasonally
adjust the time series using two methods: TRAMO-SEATS and
X-13ARIMA-SEATS.

![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic19.jpg)

**A set of pre-defined seasonal adjustment specifications**

The set of pre-defined specifications for seasonal adjustment
encompasses the most commonly used sets of seasonal adjustment
parameters. The names of these pre-defined specifications correspond to
the terminology used in TSW+. The users are strongly recommended to
start their analysis with one of those specifications (usually *RSA4c*
or *RSA5c* for X-13ARIMA-SEATS and *RSA4*, *RSA5* or *RSAfull* for
TRAMO-SEATS). The user is expected to adjust the specification to the
specific needs the using the [*Specification*
button](../case-studies/modelling-advanced.html). The default
specification for TRAMO-SEATS and multi-documents is *RSAfull*, while
for X-13ARIMA-SEATS it is RSA4c.

**Explanations for settings:**

-   **Transformation test** -- a test is performed to choose between an
    additive decomposition (no transformation) and a multiplicative
    decomposition (logarithmic transformation).

-   **Pre-adjustment for leap-year** -- a correction of the February
    values, which is applied to the original series before the
    logarithmic transformation. The original values in February are
    multiplied by \\(\frac{28.25}{29}\\) for leap years and by
    \\(\frac{28.25}{28}\\) for non-leap years. Values for other months
    are not modified.

-   **Working days** -- a pre-test is made for a presence of a working
    day effect.

-   **Trading days** -- a pre-test is made for a presence of a trading
    day effect.

-   **Easter** -- a pre-test for a presence of the Easter effect. The
    default length of the Easter effect is 6 days (for TRAMO-SEATS
    specifications) and 8 days (for X-13ARIMA-SEATS specifications).

-   **Outliers** -- an automatic identification of three types of
    outliers: AO (additive outliers), LS (level shifts) and TC
    (transitory changes), using a default critical value.

-   **ARIMA model** -- the choice between fixing the ARIMA model
    structure to (0,1,1)(0,1,1) or searching for the ARIMA model using
    an automatic model identification procedure (AMI). The
    (0,1,1)(0,1,1) model (called the Airline model) is used as a default
    model in several TRAMO-SEATS and X-13ARIMA-SEATS specifications
    because it has been shown in many studies that this model is
    appropriate for many real seasonal monthly or a quarterly time
    series. Moreover, the Airline model approximates well many other
    models and provides an excellent "benchmark"
    model[^graphical-user-interface-2].

#### User-defined specifications

The user may add new seasonal adjustment specifications to the
*Workspace* window. To do it, go to the *Seasonal adjustment* section,
right click on the *tramoseats* or *x13* item in the *specifications*
node and select *New* from the local menu.

![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic20.jpg)

**Creating a new specification in the *Seasonal adjustment* section**

Next, double click on the newly created specification, change the
settings accordingly and confirm with the **OK** button.

**Changing settings of seasonal adjustment specification**

### Defining and modifying a specification

In general, the user can choose the parameters of the seasonal
adjustment process by creating a specification with given settings or by
changing some settings in the specification currently in use.

1.  To create a new specification go to the *Workspace* window and
    choose a node, to which you wish to add a specification (*Modelling*
    or *Seasonal adjustment*). Then choose a method (*tramo* or
    *regarima* for *Modelling*, *tramoseats* or *x13* for *Seasonal
    adjustment*). Click on the left mouse button and choose a *New*
    option. The user can also import the specification from the external
    file with the *Import from* option.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image1.jpg)

    **Creating a new specification**

2.  Next, unfold the node (the *tramoseats* node in the case presented
    here) and right click on the newly created specification
    (*TramoSeatsSpec-1* in the case presented below) to open the local
    menu. The local menu offers the following options:

    -   **Open** -- displays the specification's settings

    -   **Export to** -- enables the user to save the specification in a
        config file.

    -   **Delete** -- removes the specification from the workspace.

    -   **Rename** -- enables the user to change the name of the
        user-defined specification.

    -   **Edit comments** -- a functionality for monitoring how a
        seasonal adjustment process is implemented. The user can add and
        modify short notes concerning a given time series. These notes
        are visible in the *Comments* column in the *Processing* window.
        The notes are displayed when the user hovers the mouse on the
        given cell.

    -   **Create document** -- adds a new document to the relevant place
        in the *Seasonal adjustment → documents* section and assigns the
        specification selected by the user to it.

    -   **Clone** -- creates the copy of the specification and adds it
        to the list.

    Chose **Open** from the menu.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image2.jpg)

    **Opening a new specification**

3.  The *Specification* window is divided into several sections. The
    actual content depends on the choice made by the user in step 1 of
    this scenario. To introduce changes unfold the sections, modify the
    current settings (choose from the list or insert the value by hand)
    and confirm the changes with the *OK* button.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SA_image3.jpg)

    **Modifying a new specification**

4.  User-defined specifications are usually used for seasonal adjustment
    of many time series (*Statistical methods* → *Seasonal adjustment* →
    *Multi Processing* → *New*). The user can also make changes to the
    specification after the modelling/seasonal adjustment process. In
    such a case, to introduce changes click on the *Specification*
    button. JDemetra+ opens the *Specifications* panel on the right.
    Unfold the sections, modify the current settings (choose from the
    list or type a new value) and confirm the changes with the *Apply*
    button. JDemetra+ automatically applies the new settings and
    displays the outcome resulting from the modified specification.

    **Modifying a specification, which is currently in use**

### Tramo-seats specification setting

This section discusses the options available for the TRAMO-SEATS
specifications, which are based on the original program developed by
Agustin Maravall and Victor Gómez. It is divided into five parts that
correspond to the TRAMO-SEATS specification sections and are presented
in the order in which they are displayed in the graphical interface of
JDemetra+.

![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic22.jpg)

**A list of the TRAMO-SEATS specification's sections**

To avoid unnecessary repetitions, click on the respective link for a
description of the following sections of the TRAMO/SEATS specification:

-   [*Estimate*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#estimate);
-   [*Transformation*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#transformation);
-   [*Regression*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#regression);
-   [*Outliers*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#outliers);
-   [*Arima*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#arima).

This section focuses on the decomposition part of the seasonal
adjustment process and the options for benchmarking.

To facilitate the comparison between JDemetra+ specifications and
specifications used in TSW+, under each option the name of the
corresponding parameter from the original software is given, if any. For
an exact description of the different parameters originating from TSW+,
the user should refer to the documentation of TSW+. For each parameter
the default parameter value, which is displayed for a template created
in the *Workspace* window, is reported.

For the pre-defined specifications the items are fixed, while in the
case of the user-defined specifications the user can set them
individually. However, in some cases the choice of a given value results
in a limitation of the possible alternatives for other parameters.
Therefore, the user is not entirely free to set the parameters values.

#### Series

In the context of seasonal adjustment it is usually assumed that long
time series are those exceeding twenty years of length. Performing
seasonal adjustment of long time series can be difficult. Over such a
long period the underlying data generating process can change,
determining changes also in the components and in the components
structure. In this case the adjustment over the whole series may produce
sub-optimal results mainly in the most recent period and in the initial
parts of the series. Therefore it is reasonable to limit long time
series to the most recent observations. The *Series* section allows the
user to limit the span (data interval) of the data to be modelled or
seasonally adjusted.

###### **Series span → type**<br> *--; --*

Specifies the span (data interval) of the time series to be used in the
seasonal adjustment process. When the user limits the original time
series to a given span, only this span will be used in the computations.
The available parameters for this option are: \* *All* -- full time
series span is considered in the seasonal adjustment; \* *From* -- date
of the first time series observation is included in the seasonal
adjustment; \* *To* -- date of the last time series observation is
included in the seasonal adjustment; \* *Between* -- dates of the first
and the last time series observations are included in the seasonal
adjustment; \* *Last* -- a specific number of observations from the end
of the time series is included in the seasonal adjustment; \* *First* --
a specific number of observations from the beginning of the time series
is included in the seasonal adjustment; \* *Excluding* -- a specific
number of observations is excluded from the beginning (*First*) and/or
end (*Last*) of the time series in the seasonal adjustment. With the
options *Last*, *First* and *Excluding* the span can be computed
dynamically on the series. The default setting is *All*.

###### **Series span → Preliminary check**<br> *--; --*

When marked, it checks the quality of the input series and excludes from
a processing the highly problematic ones: e.g. these with a high number
of outliers, identical observations and/or missing values above the
respective threshold values. When unmarked, the thresholds are ignored
and process is performed, when possible. By default, the checkbox is
marked.

#### Seats

This section includes the settings relevant for the decomposition step,
performed by the [SEATS algorithm](../theory/SA_SEATS.html).

###### **Prediction length**<br> *Seats parameters; npred*

Number of forecasts used in the decomposition. Positive values
correspond to the number of months while negative values correspond to
the numbers of years.

###### **Approximation mode**<br> *Seats parameters; noadmiss*

In general, SEATS decomposes the ARIMA model received from TRAMO. On
some occasions, the ARIMA model identified by TRAMO results in a so
called non-admissible decomposition i.e. a decomposition for which the
condition that all components have a non-negative spectrum for all
frequencies has failed. In such cases an approximation might be used to
choose an acceptable ARIMA model. The available actions that can be
performed in the case of a non-admissible decomposition are:

-   *None* -- when the model does not accept an admissible
    decomposition, no approximation is made, which means that no
    decomposition is performed by SEATS.
-   *Legacy* -- when the model does not accept an admissible
    decomposition, it is automatically replaced with a decomposable one.
    The forecasts of the components obtained from SEATS with a new ARIMA
    model (sum of the components forecasts) will not add to the series
    forecast of the model passed by TRAMO.
-   *Noisy* -- a new ARIMA model is obtained by adding a white noise to
    the non-admissible model estimated by TRAMO. In this case, the
    forecasts of the series from TRAMO and from SEATS are the same; also
    the sum of the components forecasts is the same as the forecast of
    the series with the TRAMO model.

The default setting is *Legacy*.

###### **MA unit root boundary**<br> *Seats parameters; xl*

A parameter to control the estimation of the AR and MA roots of the
model. When the modulus of a root converges within an interval around 1,
the program automatically fixes the root. More specifically, when the
modulus of an estimated root falls in the range
(<em>xl</em><strong>,</strong> 1), it is set to 1 if it is a root in the
AR polynomial. If a root is in the MA polynomial, it is set to *xl*. The
default value is 0.95.

###### **Trend boundary**<br> *Seats parameters; rmod*

The trend boundary is defined for the modulus of the inverse of the real
AR roots. If the modulus of the inverse of the real root is greater than
the <strong>Trend boundary</strong>, the AR root is integrated into the
trend component. Otherwise the root is integrated into the seasonal
component or transitory component (see <strong>Seasonal
boundary</strong>). The default parameter value is 0.5.

###### **Seasonal tolerance**<br> *Seats parameters; epsphi*

The tolerance (measured in degrees) to allocate the AR non-real roots to
the seasonal component (if the modulus of the inverse complex AR root is
greater than the <strong>Trend boundary</strong> and the frequency of
this root differs from one of the seasonal frequencies by less than
<strong>Seasonal tolerance</strong>) or the transitory component
(otherwise). The default parameter value is [$\frac{\pi}{90}$]{.math
.inline} rad (2 degrees).

###### **Seasonal boundary**<br> *Seats parameters; smod*

The seasonal boundary is defined for the modulus of the inverse of the
real negative AR roots. If the modulus of the inverse negative real root
is greater (or equal) than <strong>Seasonal boundary</strong>, the AR
root is integrated into the seasonal component. Otherwise the root is
integrated into the trend or transitory component (see <strong>Trend
boundary</strong>). The default parameter value is 0.8.

###### **Seasonal boundary (unique)**<br> *Seats parameters; smod*

A boundary, from which a negative AR root is integrated in the seasonal
component when the root is the unique seasonal root. The default
parameter value is 0.8.

###### **Method**<br> *--; --*

The estimation method of the unobserved components.

Options: - *Burman* -- the algorithm, which is used by the original
TRAMO/SEATS method. Although it is the most efficient one, it cannot
handle MA unit roots and it may become numerically unstable when some
roots of the MA polynomial are near 1. In such cases the
Wiener-Kolmogorov approach may lead to a significant underestimation of
the standard deviations of the components. - *KalmanSmoother* -- the
most robust algorithm. It is not disturbed by (quasi-) unit roots in MA.
It is slightly slower than the Burman's
algorithm[^graphical-user-interface-3]. It should also be noted that it
provides exact measures of the standard errors of the estimates
(identical to the McElroy's results). - *McElroyMatrix* -- the
algorithm, which is much slower than the two other options and presents
the same stability issues as the Burman's algorithm. However, it
provides additional results (full covariance matrix of the estimates)
that may be useful.

[^graphical-user-interface-3]: Description of the idea of benchmarking
    is based on Dagum, B.E., Cholette, P.A. 1994), and Quenneville, B.
    et all (2003). Detailed information can be found in: Dagum, B.E.,
    Cholette, P.A. (2006).

The default setting is *Burman*.

### Reg arima linearization

The *Model* node includes basic information about the outcome of the
model identification procedure and checking the goodness of fit. The
summary information about the final model is available directly from the
main *Model* node. The content of this panel depends on the
[settings](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html) applied to
the modelling procedure.

![Text](All_images/image22_RMSB.jpg)

**The *Model* node in the navigation tree**

The first part contains fundamental information about the model.

![Text](All_images/image23_RMSB.jpg)

**The *Summary* section of the *Model* node**

*Estimation span* informs about the first and the last observation used
for modelling. The notation of the estimation span varies according to
the frequencies (for example, the span $$2-1993 : 10-2006$$ represents a
monthly time series and the span $$II-1994 : I-2011$$ represents a
quarterly time series). The message *Series has been log-transformed* is
only displayed if a logarithmic transformation has been applied.

In the case of [the pre-defined
specifications](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html): TR0,
TR1, TR3, RG0, RG1 and RG3 no trading day effect is estimated. For TR2,
RG2c, TR4 and RG4c pre-defined specifications, working day effects and
the leap year effect are pre-tested and estimated if present. If the
working day effect is significant, the pre-processing part includes the
message *Working days effect (1 regressor)*. The message *Working days
effect (2 regressors)* means that the leap year effect has also been
estimated. For TR5 and RG5c the trading day effect and the leap year
effect are pre-tested. If the trading day effect has been detected,
either of the messages *Trading days effect (6 regressors)* or *Trading
days effect (7 regressors)* are displayed, depending whether the leap
year effect has been detected or not. If the Easter effect is
statistically significant, *Easter effect detected* is displayed.

In this section the total number of detected outliers is displayed. The
additional information on detected outliers, i.e. type, location and
coefficients' values, can be found in the *Arima model* subsection of
the *Model* node.

The *Final model* section informs about the outcome of the estimation
process. *Number of effective observations* is the number of
observations used to estimate the model, i.e. the number of observations
of the transformed series (regularly and/or seasonally differenced)
reduced by the *Number of estimated parameters*, which is the sum of
regular and seasonal parameters for both autoregressive and moving
average processes, mean effect, trading/working day effect, outliers,
regressors and one.

*Likelihood* is a maximized value of a
Likelihood[^graphical-user-interface-4] function after the iterations
processed in Exact Maximum Likelihood Estimation, which is a method used
to estimate the model. This value is used by the model selection
criteria: *AIC*, *AICC*, *BIC (corrected by length)* and
*Hannan-Quinn*[^graphical-user-interface-5]. *Standard error of the
regression (ML estimate)* is the standard error of the regression from
Maximum Likelihood Estimation[^graphical-user-interface-6].

[^graphical-user-interface-4]: The likelihood function is the joint
    probability (density) function of observable random variables. It is
    viewed as the function of the parameters given the realized random
    variables. Therefore, this function measures the probability of
    observing the particular set of dependent variable values that occur
    in the sample.

[^graphical-user-interface-5]: [AIC, AICC, BIC and Hannan-Quinn criteria
    are used by X-13ARIMA-SEATS while BIC (TRAMO
    definition)](../theory/SA_lin.html#model-selection-criteria) by
    TRAMO/SEATS. These criteria are used in seasonal adjustment
    procedures for the selection of the optimum ARIMA model. The model
    with the smaller value of the model selection criteria is preferred.

[^graphical-user-interface-6]: Maximum Likelihood Estimation is a
    statistical method for estimating the coefficients of a model. This
    method determines the parameters that maximize the probability
    (likelihood) of the sample data.

The *scores at the solution* section presents the gradient of the
loglikelihood. The different items of the scores are related to the
different parameters of the ARIMA model. The output indicates to which
extent the optimization procedure reached the maximum. At the maximum of
the likelihood, it should be 0. However, it is never exactly the case,
due to numerical approximations. Usually, the scores can be improved by
using a higher precision (smaller tolerance). This precision is
controlled by the **Tolerance** parameter in the **Estimate** section of
the *Specifications* window (see how to use this parameter [for
Tramo](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#estimate) and [for
Arima](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-arima.html#estimate)).

An example of the output is presented in the chart below.

![Text](All_images/image24_RMSB.jpg)

**The content of the *Final model* section**

Next, the estimated values of model parameters (*Coefficients*),
t-statistics (*T-Stat*) and corresponding p-values (*P*$$\|T\|\>t$$) are
displayed. JDemetra+ uses the following notation:

-   *Phi(p)* -- the \\(p\^{\text{th}}\\) term in the non-seasonal
    autoregressive polynomial;

-   *Theta(q)* -- the $q^{\text{th}}$ term in the non-seasonal moving
    average polynomial;

-   *BPhi(P)* -- the $P^{\text{th}}$ term in the seasonal autoregressive
    polynomial;

-   *BTheta(Q)* -- the $Q^{\text{th}}$ term in the seasonal moving
    average polynomial.

In the example below, the ARIMA model (0,1,1)(0,1,1) was chosen, which
means that one regular and one seasonal moving average parameter were
identified and estimated. The p-values indicate that *BTheta(1)*
parameter is significant in contrast to the *Theta(1)*, which is not
significant [^graphical-user-interface-7].

[^graphical-user-interface-7]: The variable is called statistically
    significant if it is so extreme that such a result would be expected
    to arise simply by chance only in rare circumstances (with the
    probability equal to p-value). Generally, the regressor is thought
    to be significant if p-value is lower than 5%.

![Text](All_images/image25_RMSB.jpg)

**The estimation's results of the ARIMA model**

For the [fixed ARIMA
parameters](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#tramo-specification--options-for-manual-identification-of-the-arima-model),
JDemetra+ shows only the values of the parameters. Figure below presents
the output from the manually chosen ARIMA model (2,0,0)(0,1,1) with a
fixed parameter *BTheta(1).* For the fixed parameter the *T-Stat* and
*(P\|T\|\>t)* are not displayed as no estimation is done for this
parameter.

![Text](All_images/image26_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of the ARIMA model with a fixed
coefficient**

If the ARIMA model contains a constant term (detected automatically or
introduced by the user), the estimated value and related statistics are
reported.

![Text](All_images/image27_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of a mean effect**

JDemetra+ presents estimated values of the coefficients of one or six
regressors depending on the type of a calendar effect specification. For
a working days effect one regressor is estimated.

![Text](All_images/image28_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of a working day effect**

When a trading days effect is estimated the *Joint F-test* value is
reported under the table that presents estimated values. When the result
of *Joint F-test* indicates that the trading day variables are jointly
not significant the test result is displayed in red.

![Text](All_images/image29_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of a trading day effect: the case of
jointly not significant variables**

In the example below the RSA5c specification has been used and a trading
day effect has been detected. In spite of the fact that some trading day
regressors are not significant at the 5% significance level, the outcome
of the joint F-test indicates that the trading day regressors are
jointly significant (the F-test statistic is lower than 5%).

![Text](All_images/image30_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of a trading day effect: the case of
jointly significant variables**

If a leap year regressor has been used in the model specification, the
value of the estimated leap year coefficient is also reported with the
corresponding t-statistics and p-value. As the p-value presented on the
picture below is greater than 0.05, it indicates that the leap year
effect is not significant.

![Text](All_images/image31_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of a leap year effect**

When the option
[*UserDefined*](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#regression)
is used, JDemetra+ displays the *User-defined calendar variables*
section with variables and corresponding estimation results (the values
of the parameters, corresponding t-statistics and p-values). The outcome
of the joint F-test is displayed when more than one user-defined
calendar variable is used.

![Text](All_images/image32_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of user-defined calendar variables**

When the Easter effect is estimated, the following table is displayed in
the output. In the case presented below Easter has a negative,
significant effect on the time series.

![Text](All_images/image33_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of the Easter effect**

JDemetra+ also presents the results of an outlier detection procedure.
The table includes the type of outlier, its date, the value of the
coefficient and corresponding t-statistics and p-values.

![Text](All_images/image34_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the outlier identification procedure**

In all pre-defined specifications, except for TR0 and RG0, only additive
outliers, temporary changes and level shifts are considered in the
automatic outlier identification procedure. When seasonal outliers are
also enabled, they appear in the same table as other outliers.

![Text](All_images/image35_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the outlier identification procedure that enables
seasonal outliers**

Results for [pre-specified
outliers](../reference-manual/modelling-spec-tramo.html#regression) are
displayed in a separate table.

![Text](All_images/image36_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of the pre-specified outliers**

Regression variables, like ramps and intervention variables, are not
identified automatically. They need to be defined by the user. The
results of an estimation of ramps that are pre-defined types of
regression variables are displayed in a separate table. All information
concerning ramps, including spans, estimated coefficients and related
statistics, is shown in a separate table.

![Text](All_images/image37_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of the ramp effect**

All other intervention variables with corresponding statistics are shown
under the *Intervention variable(s)* table.

![Text](All_images/image38_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of the intervention variable**

User-defined variables are marked as *Vars-1.x_1, Vars-1.x_2*, ...,
*Vars-1.x_n* and displayed in the separate tables.

![Text](All_images/image39_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of the user-defined variables**

JDemetra+ also reports a list of missing observations, if any. JDemetra+
applies the AO approach to the estimation of the missing
observations[^graphical-user-interface-8].

[^graphical-user-interface-8]: Missing observations are treated as
    additive outliers and interpolated accordingly.

![Text](All_images/image40_RMSB.jpg)

**The results of the estimation of the missing observations**

Detailed results are divided into several sections and are investigated
in the following sections: -
[Forecasts](../reference-manual/forecasts.html) -
[Regressors](../reference-manual/regressors.html) -
[ARIMA](../reference-manual/arima.html) - [Pre-adjustment
series](../reference-manual/pre-adjustment-series.html) -
[Residuals](../reference-manual/residuals.html) -
[Likelihood](../reference-manual/likelihood.html)

#### Theoretical spectrum of the Arima model

The *Arima* section demonstrates [a theoretical
spectrum](../theory/spectral.html) of the stationary and non-stationary
models. The local menu, which is available for the graph, offers the
copy and export options, including sending the graph to the printer and
saving the graph as clipboard or as a file in the PNG format. The *Copy
all visible* option enables the user to export time series data to the
another application.

![Text](All_images/RM_C_pic02.jpg)

### X-11 Specification setting

#### Customised seasonal filters

JDemetra+ offers the options to assign a different seasonal filter
length to each period (month or quarter). The program offers these
options in the *single spec* mode as well as in the *multispec* mode,
albeit they are available only in the *Specifications* window, after a
document is created.

1.  Go to the X11-part of the *Specification* window (see step 8 from
    the [Simple seasonal adjustment of a single time
    series](../case-studies/simplesa-single.html) scenario). By default
    a single pre-defined filter length (*Msr*) is used for all months or
    quarters.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SF_image1.jpg)

    **Default seasonal filter options**

2.  To change the seasonal filter for all months/quarters, use a drop
    down menu, which is displayed after clicking on the cell next to the
    *Seasonal filter* option.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SF_image2.jpg)

    **Choosing a seasonal filter for all periods**

3.  To change the filter length for a single month, click on the empty
    cell next to *Details* on seasonal filters. A new window appears in
    which the filter lengths for each month is given. Click on the cell
    next to the month in which the filter length is to be changed. Again
    a drop down menu appears where the filter length can be selected.
    Once the changes are introduced close this window.

## Adding User-defined variables

User defined variables are simply time series used as explanatory
regressors in the RegARIMA and the TRAMO models. Although JDemetra+
allows the user to indicate any time series as a variable to avoid
misleading or erroneous results, the following rules should be kept: \*
User-defined regression variables are used for measuring abnormalities
and therefore they should not contain a seasonal pattern. \* JDemetra+
assumes that user-defined regressors are already in an appropriately
centred form. Therefore the mean of each user-defined regressor needs to
be subtracted from the regressor or means for each calendar period
(month or quarter) need to be subtracted from each of the user-defined
regressors.

JDemetra+ considers two kinds of user-defined regression variables: \*
**Static variables**, usually imported directly from external software
(by drag/drop or copy/paste). The observations for static variables
cannot be changed. The only way to update static series is to remove
them from the list and to re-import them with the same names. \*
**Dynamic variables** that are imported into the *Variables* panel by
dragging and dropping series from a browser of the application,
available in the *Providers* window. Dynamic variables are automatically
updated each time the application is re-opened. Therefore, it is a
convenient solution for creating user-defined variables.

To create a dynamic variable first right-click on the *Variables* node
in the *Workspace* window and chose the option **New**.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref_d3.jpg)

**Creating an empty dataset for the user-defined variables**

Next, double click on the newly created *Vars-1* item to display it in
the *Results* panel. By default, JDemetra+ uses the conventions
Vars\_#number to name the tabs under the *Variables* node.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref_d4.jpg)

**Activation of an empty dataset for the user-defined variables**

Then, go to *Providers* window and open your file that contains external
variables following the instructions provided
[here](../quick-start/datasources.html). Drag and drop your external
regressors from the *Providers* window to the *Vars-1* window.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref_d5.jpg)

**Importing the user-defined variables to JDemetra+**

The original name of the series is recorded in the *Description* column
of the *Variables* window.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref_d6.jpg)

**Assigning regressors from the *Providers* window to the user-defined
variables**

In order to rename the series in the *Variables* window, right click on
the series and chose **Rename**.

![Text](All_images/A_Ref_d7.jpg)

**A local menu for the user-defined variables**

Once the variables are imported they can be used for further analysis
(e.g. as regressors in the [specifications for RegArima and
TRAMO](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html#user-definedSpec)).

## Seasonality tests

*Statistical Methods \>\> Seasonal Adjustment \>\> Tools \>\>
Seasonality Tests*

#### Graphical Test based on AR spectrum

The test can be applied directly to any series by selecting the option
*Statistical Methods \>\> Seasonal Adjustment \>\> Tools \>\>
Seasonality Tests*. This is an example of how results are displayed for
the case of a monthly series:

![artest](All_images/spectrum.png)\

## Series Modelling

why use this out of SA ?

## Outlier detection (TERROR)

## Benchmarking

in fact inside sa (which has to be run!)

The *Benchmarking* section allows for a
[benchmarking](../theory/benchmarking.html), i.e. forcing the annual
sums of the seasonally adjusted data to be equal to the annual sums of
the raw or calendar adjusted data.

The Benchmark algorithm is not run stand-alone but inside an
SA-Processig, using a multi document.

1.  With the [pre-defined
    specifcations](../reference-manual/sa-specifications.html) the
    benchmarking functionality is not applied by default following the
    *ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment* (2015) recommendations. It
    means that once the user has seasonally adjustd the series with a
    pre-defined specifcation the *Benchmarking* node is empty. To
    execute benchmarking click on the *Specifications* button and
    activate the checkbox in the *Benchmarking* section.

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage1.jpg)

    **Benchmarking option -- a default view**

2.  Three parameters can be set here. *Target* specifies the target
    variable for the benchmarking procedure. It can be either the
    *Original* (the raw time series) or the *Calendar Adjusted* (the
    time series adjusted for calendar effects). *Rho* is a value of the
    AR(1) parameter (set between 0 and 1). By default it is set to 1.
    Finally, *Lambda* is a parameter that relates to the weights in the
    regression equation. It is typically equal to 0 (for an additive
    decomposition), 0.5 (for a proportional decomposition) or 1 (for a
    multiplicative decomposition). The default value is 1.

3.  To launch the benchmarking procedure click on the **Apply** button.
    The results are displayed in four panels. The top-left one compares
    the original output from the seasonal adjustment procedure with the
    result from applying a benchmarking to the seasonal adjustment. The
    bottom-left panel highlights the differences between these two
    results. The outcomes are also presented in a table in the top-right
    panel. The relevant statistics concerning relative differences are
    presented in the bottom-right panel.

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage2.jpg)

    **The results of the benchmarking procedure**

4.  Both pictures and the table can be copied the usual way (see the
    [*Simple seasonal adjustment of a single time
    series*](../case-studies/simplesa-single.html) scenario).

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage3.jpg)

    **Options for benchmarking results**

5.  To export the result of the benchmarking procedure
    (*benchmarking.result*) and the target data (*benchmarking.target*)
    one needs to once execute the seasonal adjustment with benchmarking
    using the muli-processing option (see the [*Simple seasonal
    adjustment of multiple time
    series*](../case-studies/simplesa-muliple.html) scenario. Once the
    muli-processing is executed, select the *Output* item from the
    *SAProcessing* menu.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image28.jpg)

    **The *SAProcessing* menu**

6.  Expand the "+" menu and choose an appropriate data format (here
    Excel has been chosen). It is possible to save the results in TXT,
    XLS, CSV, and CSV matrix formats. Note that the [available content
    of the output depends on the output type](../theory/output.html).

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SSA_image29.jpg)

    **Exporting data to an Excel file**

7.  Chose the output items that refer to the results from the
    benchmarking procedure, move them to the window on the right and
    click **OK**.

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage4.jpg)

    **Exporting the results of the benchmarking procedure**

### Specification setting

###### **Is enabled**<br> *--; --*

Enables the user to perform a benchmarking. By default, the checkbox is
unmarked.

###### **Target**<br> *--; --*

Specifies the target variable for the benchmarking procedure.

-   *Original* -- the raw time series are considered as a target data;
-   *Calendar Adjusted* -- the time series adjusted for calendar effects
    are considered as a target data.

The default setting is *Original*.

###### **Use forecast**<br> *--; --*

The forecasts of the seasonally adjusted series and of the target
variable (<strong>Target</strong>) are used in the benchmarking
computation so the benchmarking constraint is applied also to the
forecasting period. By default, the checkbox in unmarked (forecasts are
not used).

###### **Rho**<br> *--; --*

The value of the AR(1) parameter (set between 0 and 1). The default
value of 1 is equivalent to the Denton benchmarking.

###### **Lambda**<br> *--; --*

A parameter that relates to the weights in the regression equation; it
is typically equal to 0, 1/2 or 1. A parameter equal to 1 (default
value) makes the method equivalent to the multiplicative benchmarking,
while a parameter equal to 0 makes the method equivalent to the additive
benchmarking.

## Direct-Indirect comparison

Economic time series are often computed and reported according to a
certain classification or a breakdown. For example, in National Accounts
total consumption expenditures are a sum of individual consumption
expenditures and General Government & NPISHs consumption expenditures.
Therefore, the seasonally adjusted aggregates can be computed either by
aggregating the seasonally adjusted components (indirect adjustment) or
adjusting the aggregate and the components independently (direct
adjustment). The point is that these two strategies result in different
seasonally adjusted aggregates. As neither theoretical nor empirical
evidence uniformly favours one approach over the other, the choice of
the seasonal adjustment strategy concerning aggregated series depends on
the user[^graphical-user-interface-9]. Guidance in this field is given
in the [ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment
(2015)](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/6830795/KS-GQ-15-001-EN-N.pdf/d8f1e5f5-251b-4a69-93e3-079031b74bd3)

[^graphical-user-interface-9]: Description based on the *ESS Guidelines
    on Seasonal Adjustment* (2015).

1.  JDemetra+ offers a *Direct--Indirect Seasonal Adjustment*
    functionality that facilitates the comparison of the results from
    these two strategies, which is launched from the main menu.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SF_image5.jpg)

    **The *Direct-Indirect Seasonal Adjustment* tool**

2.  To start the analysis drag and drop time series to the top-left
    panel. The panel on the right presents the sum of selected series.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SF_image6.jpg)

    **Choosing series for an analysis**

3.  By going to the main menu and clicking on *Window* → *Properties*,
    one can specify benchmarking options for direct-indirect comparison.
    Be aware that the properties window displays the properties of an
    active item. Therefore, first click on the time series graph in the
    picture below and then activate the *Properties* window.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SF_image7.jpg)

    **The properties of the *Direct - Indirect seasonal adjustment*
    functionality**

4.  By default, the [pre-defined TRAMO-SEATS
    specification](../reference-manual/sa-specifications.html#pre-defined-specifications)
    is used (RSAfull) for seasonal adjustment of a dataset. To change
    it, click on the button marked in the picture below. This will
    provide you with the alternative specifications. Here the user
    defined specification named *My spec* is chosen.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SF_image8.jpg)

    **Choosing a specification for the analysis**

5.  Next, run the process by clicking the button with the green arrow.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SF_image9.jpg)

    **Running a process**

6.  The bottom panel presents the detailed results. The seasonality test
    node presents the outcome of the [seasonality
    tests](../theory/Tests_seas.html) performed for the aggregated
    series adjusted directly (*Direct sa*) and indirectly (*Indirect
    sa*). The reason for presenting these tests here is that the
    presence of residual seasonality and calendar effects should be
    monitored, especially in the indirectly adjusted
    series[^graphical-user-interface-10]. It might happen that the
    seasonality is successfully removed from the components but it is
    still present in the aggregated series.

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SF_image10.jpg)

    **Seasonality tests' results for a direct seasonal adjustment**

7.  The *Differences* node presents selected different results between
    the direct and the indirect seasonal adjustment approaches. The
    *Statistics* section shows basic statistics (average, standard
    deviation, minimum and maximum) for the relative differences (%)
    between the direct and the indirect SA series. *Chart* contains the
    graph of the differences, while *Table* includes the actual values.
    The *Periodogram* section presents graphs for two spectral
    estimators -- [the periodogram](../theory/spectral_periodogram.html)
    and [the auto-regressive spectrum](../theory/spectral_AR.html).

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SF_image11.jpg)

    **Graph presenting the differences between direct and indirect
    seasonal adjustment results**

8.  The *Details* node include the basic statistics for the relative
    differences between the benchmarked and original series as well as
    the actual time series adjusted directly (*Sa series*) and
    indirectly (*Benchmarked Sa series*).

    ![Text](All_images/UG_SF_image12.jpg)

## Generatiing Output

add : some explanations + link to cruncher (production chapter)

### Steps

1.  Once a seasonal adjustment process for the dataset is performed (see
    the [*Simple seasonal adjustment of a single time
    series*](../case-studies/simplesa-single.html) scenario) the results
    can be exported to the external file. Go to the main menu and follow
    the path: *SAProcessing* → *Output...*

2.  In the *Batch output* window the user can specify which output items
    will be saved and the folder in which JDemetra+ saves the results.
    It is possible to save the results in the *TXT*, *XLS*, *CSV*, and
    *CSV matrix* formats. In the first step the user should choose the
    output format from the list.

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage6.jpg)

    **Default output formats**

3.  The user may choose more than one format as the output can be
    generated in different formats at the same time.

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage7.jpg)

    **Adding an output format to the list**

4.  To display and modify the settings click on the given output format
    on the list. The available options depend on the output format.

5.  For *Csv* format the following options are available: *folder*
    (location of the file), *file prefix* (name of the file),
    *presentation* (controls how the output is divided into separate
    files) and *series* (series included in the file). These options are
    presented in the next points of this case study.

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage8.jpg)

    **Options for a *Csv* format**

6.  The user can define the folder in which the selected results and
    components will be saved (click the *folder* item and choose the
    final destination).

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage9.jpg)

    **Specifying a destination folder**

7.  With the option *File Prefix* the user can modify the default name
    of the output saved in the CSV file.

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage10.jpg)

    **Setting a *File Prefix* option**

8.  *Layout* controls how the output is divided into separate files.
    Expand the list to display available options:

    -   *HTable* -- the output series will be presented in the form of
        horizontal tables (time series in rows).

    -   *VTable* -- the output series will be presented in the form of
        vertical tables (time series in columns).

    -   *List* -- the output series will be presented in the form of
        vertical tables (time series in rows). Apart from that, for each
        time series each file contains in separate columns: the data
        frequency, the first year and of estimation span, the first
        period (month or quarter) of observation span and the number of
        observations. The files do not include dates.

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage11.jpg)

    **Layout options for a *Csv* format**

9.  The *Content* section presents [a list of series that will be
    included into a set of output files](../theory/output.html). To
    modify the initial settings click on the grey button in the
    *Content* section. The *CVS-series* window presents two panels: the
    panel on the left includes a list of all valuable output items. The
    panel on the right presents the selected output items. Mark the
    series and use the arrows to change the settings. Confirm your
    choice with the *OK* button.

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage12.jpg)

    **Specifying a content of the output file**

10. Options available for the *XLS* format are the same as for the *TXT*
    format with an exception of the *Layout* section. The list of
    available codes in the *Content* section is given
    [here](../theory/output.html).

    -   *BySeries* -- all results for a given time series are placed in
        one sheet;

    -   *ByComponent* -- results are grouped by components. Each
        component type is saved in a separate sheet.

    -   *OneSheet* -- all results are saved in one sheet.

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage13.jpg)

    **Layout options for an *Excel* format**

11. If the user sets the option layout to *ByComponent*, the output will
    be generated as follows:

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage14.jpg)

    **An Excel file view for the *ByComponent* option**

12. The option *OneSheet* will produce the following *XLS* file:

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage15.jpg)

    **An Excel file view for the *OneSheet* option**

13. By default, the series in the Excel output files are organised
    vertically. When the user unmarks the check box the horizontal
    orientation is used.

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage16.jpg)

    **The *VerticalOrientatio*n option**

14. In the case of the *TXT* format the only available options are
    *folder* (location of the file) and *series* (results included in
    the output file). The list of available codes in the *Content*
    section is given [here](../theory/output.html).

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage17.jpg)

    **Options for the *Txt* output**

15. The *CSV matrix* produces the CSV file containing information about
    the model and quality diagnostics of the seasonal adjustment. The
    user may generate the list of default items or create their own
    quality report. By default, all the available items are included in
    the output. The list of the items is given
    [here](../theory/output.html).

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage18.jpg)

    **List of items available for the *Csv matrix* output type**

16. Once the output settings are selected, click the *OK* button.

    ![Text](All_images/UDimage19.jpg)

    **Options for the *Csv matrix* output**

17. For each output JDemetra+ provides information on the status of the
    operation. An example is presented below.
